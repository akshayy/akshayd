I find myself standing at the crossroad,  
as confused as never.  
Unsure of what way to take,  
the ways seems so misty and unclear.


I make a choice and take one of them,  
I drag along it for a mile.  
I start feeling spirited only untill,  
the mist grows thicker after a while.


The fog takes over the spirits  
and I am back to square one.  
I attempt for the other way only to realise  
my journey on it ended before it had even begun.


Been at the crossroad for quite some time now,  
the dilemma has deprived me of my bliss.  
Am I not sure what way to take  
or am I not sure what my destination is?
