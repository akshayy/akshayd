When times seem tough,  
the peace and solace evades,  
the mind comes up with HOPE,  
and does not let you fade.  

The mind convinces you,  
that a miracle would happen,  
the thought fuels your spirits,  
And does not let them dampen.  

You loose track of time,  
and start enjoying the wait,  
but with every growing second,  
you grow even more desperate.  

slowly the happiness wanes,  
and you are slumped into dejection,  
its quite late when you realize my friend,  
that hope is but a sweet poison.
